      <h2 style="font-size: 50px">Impact Investing</h2>
      
      <div class="parent" id="Impact"> 	
      	<div class="child1">Impact investing is the direction of capital into companies,
organisations or funds with the intention of generating beneficial and
measurable social or environmental impact along with financial
returns. It focuses on utilising a venture building approach to grow
scalable business models that address core challenges of the
society like financial inclusion, clean energy, education, sanitation,
healthcare etc. Investing to create measurable social or
environmental impact is more relevant than ever in today’s context
of COVID-19 which has strongly affected poor and marginalised. It
has become more critical than ever to step up and invest resources
in rebuilding our communities and society.<br>
Today impact investors aren’t just high net worth families, foundations, 
pension funds or insurance companies. As per The India Impact Investing Story, 
IIC and Asha Impact, June 2020, approximately $3.5 billion out of the $10.8 billion invested over the 
last decade, came from mainstream Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investors mostly in 
the last few years. There was a dramatic improvement in the amount of funding from the impact 
investors from $860 million in 2010-12 to $4.9 billion in 2016-19, representative of their commitment. 
Impact investments have contributed to 11 of 17 SDGs and has the potential to unlock part of the $600 
billion of additional private capital needed each year to achieve India’s SDG targets.</div>

    	<h1 style="font-size: 55px;">Social enterprises benefit from impact investments</h1>
        <div style="margin: 71px" class="child3">
        	In the last decade, Impact investment has made meaningful contributions to our country’s 
development. It has provided a high degree of innovation and market-based scalability with a relatively 
modest amount, which has helped outsize impact in terms of human lives in India. In the past decade, 
equity capital of $10.8 billion flowed in at a CAGR of 26%, with a lot of the growth concentrated in the 
past two years. For each dollar of funding, at least twice as much commercial capital and impact 
investors have been brought in through impact investments. They have also helped enterprises scale 
their operations further by bringing in seed and Series-A capital. Impact investing has impacted ~200 
million people through improved service delivery for better accessibility and reach across different 
sectors primarily in the sectors of health, education, agriculture and financial services and another 
300 million people through the strategic use of technology for development. They have managed to
achieve this by driving business model and technology innovation that is focused on service delivery 
at the last mile in a way that is financially sustainable and scalable.
